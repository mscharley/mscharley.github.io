  # About me

  Hi, my name is Matthew Scharley. I'm a Drupal consultant and general web programmer based out of Melbourne, Australia.
  This is my website which I use as a blog and a place to host various projects I'm working on. If you are interested in
  hearing what I have to say then have a look at the [archive of posts][archive]. You can also find some of my popular,
  active projects listed in the menu. For others check the Github and Bitbucket links.

  I am available for work, there are various contact links in the menu. [Direct email][mail] is preferred for this though.

  The [code to this website][website-github] is [released under MIT][license]. Feel free to poke around and borrow what
  you like the HTML/CSS.
