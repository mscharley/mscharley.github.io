Just a few words to get something interesting out there that I saw today.

The following sparked some ideas in me. I'll probably post up a few things about
how to actually use this sort of thing in your own scripts, after I figure it out
myself. For now, I wanted to get this out there, because it's kind of cool.

``` html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
  tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']]}
});
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
```
