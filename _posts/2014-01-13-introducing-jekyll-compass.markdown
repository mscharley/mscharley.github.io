That's right, [I wrote a plugin for Jekyll][jekyll-compass]. Jekyll is the static site generator I use for this very
website, and I was sick of orchestrating Compass around Jekyll. [Now, Compass sings to my own tune][readme].
Specifically, this is a generator plugin for Jekyll which will take your directory of Sass or Compass files in a `_sass`
folder inside your source folder and output the results directly into your `_site` output folder. It will run
automatically whenever your site is built by Jekyll, so it will always be up to date. For example, a run of this site
might look like this:

``` console
$ jekyll build
Configuration file: D:/Websites/matt.scharley.me/_config.yml
            Source: D:/Websites/matt.scharley.me
       Destination: D:/Websites/matt.scharley.me/_site
Generating Compass: D:/Websites/matt.scharley.me/_sass => D:/Websites/matt.scharley.me/_site/css
identical _site/css/handheld.css
identical _site/css/ie8.css
identical _site/css/print.css
   remove images/sprites-s8bbc0e5b70.png
   create images/sprites-s8bbc0e5b70.png
identical _site/css/style.css

      Generating... done.
```

I originally created this plugin back just before Jekyll 1.3 was released but it's gone through a few spurts of growth
and I now feel it's up to public usage. So please, if you are using either Compass or plain Sass then please give this
plugin a shot. If you are using simple Sass, then this plugin will allow you to easily manage `@import` properly with
full partial support; and if you do decide to upgrade to Compass at some point, well, you already have you simply need
to start using it. It's worth it, I promise.
